`,

` The content is <em>overtly illogical & contradictory</em>. Distributing logically-dissonant information
like this puts the distributor in an unbalanced and potentially dangerous position
of power that must be accounted for responsibly.
`,

` The topics discussed are <strong>unverifiable</strong> even through spiritual methods, let alone scientific
evidence. This makes the distributor similar to an unquestionable religious authority and they
<em>absolutely will not</em> supplant themselves in such a position publicly.
`,

` Before going unlisted, this content had about 30 initial subscribers and two of them openly contemplated
suicide. <strong>1 in 15 is too irresponsible a risk</strong>.
`,

` This content can solicit <em>deep existential crises</em> but those weren’t the reasons for suicidal
thoughts; it provides very compelling information about the hereafter, which can make some people desire
to go there as soon as possible, while seeing very little reason to stay.
`,

` You may have a more difficult time finding purpose in life after viewing this material. For some,
the content has left them feeling adrift while for others, it’s been credited as having
“saved their lives.” This content is very extreme in that manner; it either greatly helps or hurts.
